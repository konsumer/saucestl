# saucestl

An open-source STL sharing platform.

This is meant to be a bit like thingiverse, but faster.

It's currently running [here](https://dhv3nilyqio26.cloudfront.net).

## development

To work on it, locally:

```
npm i           # install tools
npm run deploy  # deploy on AWS
npm start       # start a dev-server
```
